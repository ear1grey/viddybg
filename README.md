## Video Background on any HTML page

To underlay webcam video onto any web page&hellip;

 * Include the viddybg script file.
 * Use `ctrl alt v` to switch underlay on or off.

The image fills the screen but stays horizontally centred if the screen is narrowed, so the presenter remains central to the page.

Suggestions for improvement, alternative uses, bug reports, issues and pull requests are all very welcome.
